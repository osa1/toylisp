# ToyLisp

<img src="http://osa1.net/media/nooblisper_left.png" alt="Nooblisper" title="The man himself" align="left" />ToyLisp is a Lisp-like language that I write mostly for learning purposes.

My aim while developing it was to implement as many features as possible, without making the language completely unusable. It now supports call/cc, ~~exceptions, threads and sockets~~.


### Installation

### Usage

### TODO

* ~~Make function calls CPS~~
    * ~~Then implement call/cc~~
    * Implement exceptions.
    * Imtplement threads.
* Implement (read)
* Implement quasiquotations
* ~~Remove unnecessary error type (ThrowsError, making every error type of IOThrowsError should be better for debugging, and make the code simpler)~~

* Use GADTs for syntax tree

* Compiling to another language(OCaml ?)

* First-class macros ??

* Remove `PrimitiveFunc` type.
* Remove dotted-pairs.

* Remove IOFunc type
